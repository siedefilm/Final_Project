    <p> Hi, I’m Jake!

I am a film and digital photographer based in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. I currently study Computer Sciences, and bartend full-time. I enjoy travel, supporting local businesses, and craft beer.

My passion for photography started when I was 4 years old with a disposable camera, and since then, I’ve amassed a collection of over 46 cameras, my favorite being a Sears Made KSX SUPER. My ultimate photography goal is to be considered one of the greatest photographers such as Ansel Adams.
